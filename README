HowTo - Use maven to assemble and package a groovy based Windows NT Service


This is a learning project - Trying to figure out the best way to get to a cleanly installed running groovy based service on Windows NT.

So far, the best candidate for an NT service wrapper looks like yajsw. yajsw however seems to give us many options for packaging up a groovy class and installing it as an NT Service. This project has a trivial service class that does nothing other than emit a heartbeat every few seconds. The idea is I will also collect together the different configuration options for packaging this thing up as a groovy NT service.
